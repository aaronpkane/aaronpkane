MotivAction is a simple yet practical iOS app that delivers daily motivational quotes and turns them into actionable to-do lists — helping users stay focused, inspired, and productive.

Built With:

* Xcode

In Progress:

* Backend development and storage
* Implementing daily reminder notifications
* Custom to-do list logic based on quote themes
* Polishing UI/UX for light and dark mode

Coming soon to this profile: a full repository and demo video.
