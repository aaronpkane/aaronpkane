Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm new to coding and currently exploring the world of iOS app development using SwiftUI. I'm passionate about building tools that inspire action and make everyday life a bit more productive.

## Current Focus

* Learning: SwiftUI, Xcode, and iOS mobile app development
* Building: My first app â€” [MotivAction](#)
* Goal: Publish MotivAction on the App Store and continue building helpful, motivating apps for everyday success.

## My First App: MotivAction

MotivAction is a simple yet practical iOS app that delivers daily motivational quotes and turns them into actionable to-do lists â€” helping users stay focused, inspired, and productive.

Built With:

* SwiftUI
* Xcode

In Progress:

* Backend development and storage
* Implementing daily reminder notifications
* Custom to-do list logic based on quote themes
* Polishing UI/UX for light and dark mode
* Preparing App Store assets and launch plan

Coming soon to this profile: a full repository and demo video.
